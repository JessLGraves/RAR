R Package for Rest Activity Rhythm analysis

This package is intended for easy extraction of features of rest activity rhythms (RARs) collected using actigraphy data that has ben condensed into epochs (e.g. activity counts within 30 second, 60 second, etc epochs). This package utilizes three main approaches for analysis: 
* Parametric Approach: Sigmoidally transformed extended cosine models
* Residual Spectrum Analysis: Spectral analysis based on residuals of fitted cosine models
* Localized Measures: Mean, standard devation, and relative activity measures within user-specified time bins.

## This package is currently under continued development. Version 2 will be published in Spring 2020.
