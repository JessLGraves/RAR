# RAR: R Package for Rest Activity Rhythm analysis

This package is intended for easy extraction of features of rest activity rhythms (RARs) collected using actigraphy data that has ben condensed into epochs (e.g. activity counts within 30 second, 60 second, etc epochs). This package utilizes three main approaches for analysis: 
* Parametric Approach: Sigmoidally transformed extended cosine models
* Residual Circadian Spectrum Analysis: Spectral analysis based on residuals of fitted cosine models
* Localized Measures: Mean, standard devation, and relative activity measures within user-specified time bins.

## Example of activity patterns estimated using RAR

See <a href = "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/epdf/10.1002/sim.2466">Marler et al. 2006</a> for a summary of the model structure and parameters estimated from the models. 

__Residual Circadian Spectrum Analysis__

Spectral analysis is performed on the residuals of derived from the anti-logistic extended cosine model. From there, a user-specified specified band (a, c) for which the area under the smoothed spectrum is estimated.

Mean and standard deviation of daily log activity counts stratified by the Pittsburgh Fatigability Scale (PFS) at 4-h time bin intervals. Solid line represents greater perceived physical fatigability (PFS â‰¥ 15); dotted line represents lesser perceived physical fatigability (PFS < 15). <i>Taken from <a href = "https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/21/5/1718">Graves et al. 2021, Sensors</a></i> </sub>

## Basics of using RAR
```
install_github("JessLGraves/RAR")
data(age_wise) # example dataset
d <- age_wise

#### Cosine Modeling
rar_ex <- RAR(d, act, date_time, id_column=id) 
rar_ex$parameters # parameter estimates
rar_ex$messages # convergence messages for each participant
rar_ex$df_predicted # dataframe of obseved activity and predicted values
rar_ex4df_interp # predictions based on interpolated data (i.e. missing data)

### Residual Circadian Spectrum
spec <- RAR_Spectrum(rar_ex, "pss", TRUE, id)
RAR_Spectrum_plot(spec, ids=c("1, "29)) # plotting only participants 1 and 29
# Frequency band selection
f1 <- c(0, 2/24); f2 <- c(2/24, 25); f3 <- c(25, 60)
fs <- rbind(f1, f2, f3)
bands <- RAR_SpectrumBands(spec, fs, id_column=id) # frequency band score for each frequency interval

### Localized Measures
hour_interval <- 4
local <- RAR_Local(d, act, date_time, hour_interval, id_column=id)
local$localized # print of mean, sd, relative activity for each 4-hour time interval 
# plotting mean, sd, and relative activity
local_plots <- RAR_Local_plot(local, id_vals=c("1", "29"))
  local_plots$plot_mean
  local_plots$plot_sd
  local_plots$plot_rel
```
