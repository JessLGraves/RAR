Description: This package offers three methods of analyzing rest-activity rhythms (RARs): sigmoidally transformed extended cosine model, spectrum analysis, and localized measure of RAR. Sigmoidally transformed extended cosine model is adapted from Marler et al. 2006 <doi: 10.1002/sim.2466>. Nonparametric analyses are adapted from van Someren et al. 1996. Localized measures of RAR include the following measures at specified time bins: Mean activity, Standard Deviation of activity, and Relative activity (Graves, 2018).
